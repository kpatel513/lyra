Analyze the $ARGUMENTS profiling file for bottlenecks, and make recommendations for code improvements. Use the file /home/ubuntu/lyra/profiler_analyzer.py to parse the report.

After this analysis is generated, write some code to visualize the results. Take the following requirements into account: 
1) Make sure all bar charts are sorted by height, as this looks visually most pleasing.
2) Provide a before and after for each graph.
3) Make sure the outputs are in a consistent format across graphs.
