Please use WANDB with the API key in the .env to create a new project called lyra.
Name the run as Nicheformer.
The goal is to generate a slick interactive report in WANDB that captures the performance metrics such as throughput in tokens/sec, MFU, GPU utilization metrics, loss curves, configuration files in a nice interactive report in WANDB.
In this project, we go through a series of performance optimization steps on a research code-base, and update the artifacts into the W&B report.
