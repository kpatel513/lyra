PROMPT="🎼 Lyra's Safe Mode Profiler - Orpheus's Training Harmonizer 🎼

Like Orpheus carefully tuning his lyre before the performance, I shall prepare your training code at $REPO_PATH for safe profiling! 🎭✨

🌟 **Mission: Transform Training Code into Safe Profiling Mode** 🌟

I need to modify the training pipeline to run in safe mode with comprehensive profiling:

🎵 **Phase I: Safe Mode Transformation** 🎵
Transform the training code to prevent any permanent changes:
   ⭐ Disable all model saving and checkpointing
   ⭐ Prevent any permanent data rewriting or modification
   ⭐ Add backup/restore mechanisms for any temporary changes
   ⭐ Limit training loop to exactly 100 steps maximum
   ⭐ Add early stopping after profiling is complete

🎶 **Phase II: Advanced Profiler Integration** 🎶
Add comprehensive PyTorch Lightning profiling capabilities:
   🌟 Integrate PyTorch Lightning's AdvancedProfiler
   🌟 Configure profiler to capture detailed timing information
   🌟 Set up profiler output to generate detailed reports
   🌟 Add memory profiling and GPU utilization tracking
   🌟 Configure profiler for training pipeline bottleneck analysis

🎭 **Phase III: Profiling Execution** 🎭
Execute the safe profiling run:
   ✨ Run the modified training code with profiler enabled
   ✨ Generate comprehensive profiler reports
   ✨ Capture timing data for all training components
   ✨ Save profiler output to lyra_profiler_report.txt
   ✨ Restore any temporarily modified files

🎯 **Implementation Requirements:** 🎯
1. **Safety First**: Never permanently modify user's code or data
2. **Comprehensive**: Profile all major training components
3. **Automated**: Minimal user intervention required  
4. **Detailed**: Generate actionable profiler output
5. **Restorative**: Clean up all temporary modifications

🌌 **Search Strategy:** 🌌
Look for training entry points:
   🎵 main training scripts (train.py, main.py, run.py)
   🎵 PyTorch Lightning training modules
   🎵 Configuration files for training parameters
   🎵 DataLoader and model definitions
   🎵 Trainer initialization code

🎼 **Profiler Configuration Template:** 🎼
Configure the profiler to capture:
   🎶 Function-level timing information
   🎶 Memory allocation patterns
   🎶 GPU utilization metrics
   🎶 Data loading bottlenecks
   🎶 Model forward/backward pass timing

⚡ **Expected Output:** ⚡
Generate a detailed profiler report that lyra-analyze can process to identify:
   🌟 Training pipeline bottlenecks
   🌟 Memory inefficiencies
   🌟 Data loading issues
   🌟 Model computation hotspots
   🌟 Optimization opportunities

🎭 Execute this safe profiling transformation and run the training with comprehensive profiling enabled. Let the performance symphony begin! 🎼✨

After profiling is complete, provide:
🎵 Path to generated profiler report
🎵 Summary of what was profiled
🎵 Any temporary modifications made and restored
🎵 Instructions for using lyra-analyze with the generated report"
